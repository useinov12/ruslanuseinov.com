### Challenge

I wanted to build something that is hard and challenging and something that I have no idea how to build.
I thought that it would help me to improve my problem-solving and planning skills and improve my understanding of React.
At the time I didn't know React well and knew nothing about implementing algorithms.

And I didn't want to look at existing solutions intentionally… you know, to struggle more.

# Reflection

I approached the project as a playground to gain experience solving problems.
So I didn't got frustrated or upset if something was going wrong or if I was stuck.
Since I wasn't experienced with React, my planning horizon was too short and it was hard for me to build a coherent systematic approach to project.
Each solved problem caused additional complexity for the next one.

At some point , I've got stuck a few time and have to re-evaluete the whole approach.

For example,

My initial thinking was something like this:\
”I can write algo and execute, but can not visualize it once it is executed. So I need to execute and visualize simultaneously and slow down the speed of execution.”

I could not come up with a better idea for implementing visualization, than executing algo and display in real-time.
So my initial approach was to build a Reducer function that will track and execute algorithm steps based current set of conditions.
How do I trigger each step of Reducer? With the setInterval function until the state of Reducer is not going to reach 'Sorted'.  
Writing a Reducer for each algo was complex, but it is solved the problem - I can execute and visualize each step of the algo.

_And remember - I didn't want to look at existing solutions._

But then I stuck at Merge sort and realized that the whole approach was super complex and there is definitely a better way.

### Conclusion

Despite the fact that it was extremely time-consuming, I gained a deeper understanding of React and algorithms, learned to plan ahead, think strategically and gained confidence to tackle problems on my own.
