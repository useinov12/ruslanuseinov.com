# Our approach

We separated our work in three parts:

1. Our internal API - user Authentification\
   That includes user CRUD operations

2. User's bank connection - permitting access to user bank data with Plaid API\
   That includes invoking Plaid UI and going throught it's workflow.
   The end goal of this workflow is to get access key and save it in our database for future use

3. Data fetching - requesting and displaing data using Plaid API\
   Using PLAID keys that cerated during bank connection -
   make API calls for bank's data aggregate it and display to our dashboards

## Authentification

We have our own Authentification process handled by our Server.

On the Client I built the following pages:

- Landing
- Signup
- Cabinet

---

## User flow

Users can sign in on the landing page with a sign-in popup or on the dedicated `/signup` page

If the user would access the protected page while not authenticated

- user will be redirected to `/signup` page
- after successful sign-in user will be redirected to the page that he/she tried to access
