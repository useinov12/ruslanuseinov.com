## Version control system(VCS)

A tool for tracking and managing changes to source code and other
files in a software development project

<MdxCard type='info'>
  **Git** is a standard for version control system and essential tool for software development.
</MdxCard>


Understanding Git allows developers to effectively manage their code
and collaborate with others, which is crucial for the success
of software development projects.

## Why it is important?

> Collaborate, experiment and enfotce quality

By using a VCS, developers can ensure the quality and reliability of their code, and
can easily track the progress of their projects over time.

## How is it working?

By creating the versions(**_branches_**) of the source code, where developers can work for
isolated problem and integrating(**_merging_**) their changes to the source
code(main branch that considered to be the source of the truth)

## Common Git best practices

1. Use descriptive and concise commit messages
2. Avoid large commits
3. Use branches for different features
4. Regularly pull and merge changes
5. Review changes before merging
6. Use tags to mark important milestones

## Workflow patterns

> There are few Git workflow patterns that can be used by teams or by individual developers.
> Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

### Rebasing Workflow

A rebasing workflow is a Git workflow that is used by individual developers who prefer to keep
their commits linear and avoid merge commits. In this workflow, changes are frequently rebased
onto the main branch to keep the history of the project linear.

### Centralized Workflow

A centralized workflow is a simple Git workflow that is well-suited to
small teams or individual developers. In this workflow, all team members push their changes to
a single central repository

### Feature Branch Workflow

A feature branch workflow is a more sophisticated Git workflow that is
well-suited to larger teams. In this workflow, each feature is developed in its own branch, and
changes are merged into the main branch when they are ready to be released.

### Forking Workflow

A forking workflow is a Git workflow that is used in open-source projects.
In this workflow, developers fork the main repository and make changes in their own forks.
When their changes are ready, they submit a pull request to the main repository, and the changes
are reviewed and merged if approved.
